# PAV Speaker Classification and Verification with Deep Neural Networks

This is an implementation of https://github.com/santi-pdp/pav_spkid_pytorch, The objetcive of this project is to implement a speaker identifier using Neural Networks over a previously calculated feature vector. Additionally to the classifier function for which that program was designed, a verification function has been added.
